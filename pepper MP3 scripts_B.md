89 	Yes, we do have to hear about the dog dream. Steve dreamed that he was standing on a concrete covered lot beside a river and next to a post office. A woman comes and stands near to Steve, but closer to the river. Steve tells her “ I’m sorry ma’m, you can’t stand here, this is where the dogs come ashore”. The dogs have pouches on their backs which contain the mail. They’re taking it to the post office.  The dogs are swimming across the river to take the mail to the post office! 38 sec

**Songs**

These songs are not in the MP3 folder. You will need to supply your own audio clips for these. Alternatively, you could use some of the included clips by changing the number and delay in the programs. I bought most of these on Itunes, copied them as MP3 with Itunes and imported them into Audacity. From Audacity, I copied them into the SD card
